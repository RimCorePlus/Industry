# Neutroamine Production
For this mod, I'm going to assume neutroamine is aniline. Aniline is a chemical compound used in the production of pharmaceuticals, including analgesics, antibacterials, and antimalarials.

I think I'll use the VE pipe system to streamline synthesis.

## Refining Raw Materials
Tree bark and/or oil-rich plants are refined at a biofuel refinery `phenolic extract`.
Limestone blocks are heated at a furnace, decomposing the nitrate and producing `nitric acid`.
Iron and coal from simple chains - steel are heated at a furnace to make `iron dust`, which will be important later.

## Refining Secondary Materials
`Phenolic extract`, `nitric acid`, and `iron dust` are heated at a drug lab to create `ironized nitrobenzene`, a yellowish liquid.
`Ironized nitrobenzene` is placed in a chemical synthesizer where it is automatically processed (similar to deepchem refinery) to output aniline (neutroamine).

From there, the neutroamine would need to move from the chemical synthesizer into a vat for storage and/or withdrawal. Reference the pipe system VRE - Androids uses for neutroamine.
