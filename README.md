Scope of this mod:
- Rebalance the acquisition and use of industrial materials such as components and cloth
- Prepatch and potentially provide the framework for add-on modules

## Additions
Currently none while the cloth and lumber chains are being rewritten.

## Changes
### Components
- Can now be crafted at the machining table at the cost of 20% decreased work speed

### To-do:
- Cotton and devilstrand yield raw ingredients that must be processed into fabric at a loom
- Merge the Simple Chains series into this mod
- - SC - Steel worked almost perfectly out of the box
- - Leather and Lumber used SYR processor framework as a dependency, and I'd really like to avoid using the community continued version of that mod
- - I'll check and see if Vanilla Expanded Framework has anything useful (maybe the pipe network update added some processors?)
- Create neutroamine chain
- - Use iron from Simple Chains - Steel to facilitate neutroamine synthesis (more details in neutroamine.md)
