Scope of this mod:
- Rebalance existing production chains for manufactured goods
- Add production chains for goods that cannot otherwise be crafted

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requires [Vanilla Expanded Framework](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2023507013).

## Changes
### Components
- Craftable at the machining table with a 20% increased work requirement compared to fabrication

### Neutroamine
- (WIP) ~~Can now be synthesized in an expensive three step process~~

### Textiles
- Cotton and devilstrand plants now yield raw fiber that must be spun before it can be used for tailoring
- To offset this additional step, the new 2x1 electric spinning wheel can stack with two tool cabinets for an 18% work speed boost on tailoring benches

### Wood
- Lumber production chain
- Firewood
