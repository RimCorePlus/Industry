# [CorePlus] Industry - Metal
![](About/Preview.png)\
[![GPLv3][badge-license]](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

Spiritual successor to [Simple Chains: Steel](https://github.com/Owlchemist/simple-chains-steel) by Owlchemist. Originally forked for 1.5, almost all of the XML has been rewritten and expanded to cover silver and gold.

## Changes
- Adds production chains for steel, silver (toggable), and gold (toggable)
- [Toggable patches](#toggable-patches) to improve vanilla metal balance

### Refining
|  | Ore (Bulk) | Coal (Bulk) | Work amount (Bulk) | Output (Bulk) |
|---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Steel | 15 (60) | 5 (20) | 1000 (4000) | 15 (60) |
| Silver | 50 (200) | 5 (20) | 1125 (4500) | 50 (200) |
| Gold | 10 (40) |  | 1250 (5000) | 10 (40) |

### Analysis
Production chains add tedium to the game. This is good for immersion, but (in my experience) detracts from the overall experience when there's no benefit. Accordingly, the refining recipes have been balanced to maximize output per job and create a stream of income for mining colonies that doesn't break the economy.

Here's how refining jobs compare to vanilla money making activities. The per hour profit is based on added value.
|  | Profit/hour |
|---:|:---:|
| Rolling smokeleaf joints | 25 |
| **Steel refining** | **35** |
| Making tribalwear | 43 |
| **Silver refining** | **50** |
| Go-juice production | 55 |
| **Gold refining** | **60** |
| Flake production | 64 |

Wealth management is another upside of refining chains over vanilla mining. Since raw materials are worth less than their refined counterparts, mining large veins doesn't drastically inflate your colony's wealth. Refining bills can be managed to meet the colony's needs without creating excess wealth.

### Toggable Patches
- Metal is not flammable
- Gold and silver are beautiful
- Increase steel durability
- Increase uranium durability
- Increase plasteel durability
- Remove compacted plasteel
